# PC Building Guide
*by Brandon Buttlar*

## Purpose and Audience
The purpose of this repository is to be an informative guide about building a desktop PC from scratch. Each section will detail what part needs to be added to the PC and will include an informative segment about the part that is being installed. This guide is meant for anyone from ages 12 and up interested in building a PC, so no prior experience in IT is necessary for following this guide.

## Intro
Whether you're a gaming enthusiast, a creative professional, or simply someone who loves a good DIY project, building your own PC can be a rewarding and cost-effective way to get exactly the performance you need without having to pay extra for assembly and handling.

Required tools:

* Screwdriver: A magnetic tip Phillips head screwdriver is ideal for most builds.
* Anti-Static Wrist Strap: To protect your components from static electricity.
* Thermal Paste: Essential for installing the CPU cooler (though many coolers come with paste pre-applied).
* Cable Ties: For managing cables and ensuring good airflow.
* Scissors or Snips: To cut cable ties and open packaging.
* Flashlight: Helpful for seeing into your case's nooks and crannies.
* Workspace: A clean, spacious, and static-free surface.

## Components

### 1. **Central Processing Unit (CPU)**
   - **Description**: The CPU is the brain of your computer, handling all instructions it receives from hardware and software.
   - **Installation Tips**: Handle the CPU carefully, aligning it with the motherboard's socket without forcing it.

### 2. **Motherboard**
   - **Description**: This is the main circuit board of your PC. It allows communication between all other components.
   - **Installation Tips**: Secure the motherboard in the case using standoffs and screws.

### 3. **Random Access Memory (RAM)**
   - **Description**: RAM is the short-term memory of your computer, storing data for quick access.
   - **Installation Tips**: Insert RAM sticks into their slots on the motherboard until they click into place.

### 4. **Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)**
   - **Description**: The GPU handles rendering images, video, and animations, especially important for gaming or video editing.
   - **Installation Tips**: Install the GPU into the PCIe slot on the motherboard and secure it to the case.

### 5. **Storage (SSD/HDD)**
   - **Description**: Storage devices hold all your data, programs, and the operating system. SSDs are faster but more expensive than HDDs.
   - **Installation Tips**: Mount the storage drives in the case and connect them to the motherboard and power supply.

### 6. **Power Supply Unit (PSU)**
   - **Description**: The PSU provides power to your PC's components.
   - **Installation Tips**: Fit the PSU into its bay and connect power cables to the motherboard, GPU, and storage drives.

### 7. **PC Case**
   - **Description**: The case houses all your components. It also plays a role in cooling and aesthetics.
   - **Installation Tips**: Choose a case that fits all your components and has good airflow.

### 8. **Cooling System**
   - **Description**: Cooling systems prevent overheating. They can be air coolers or liquid cooling systems.
   - **Installation Tips**: Install the CPU cooler and case fans to ensure adequate airflow.

## Building

1. **Prepare Your Workspace**
   - Ensure a clean, static-free environment. Lay out all tools and components.
   - Wear an anti-static wrist strap to prevent damage to electronic parts.

2. **Install the CPU**
   - Open the CPU socket on the motherboard gently, outside of the case.
   - Align the CPU with the socket, looking for the marking that indicates the correct orientation.
   - Carefully place the CPU into the socket without applying pressure. It should fit snugly.
   - Secure the CPU into place with the motherboard's securing mechanism.
  
3. **Install the RAM**
   - Open the RAM slots on the motherboard.
   - Align the notches on the RAM sticks with the keys in the slots.
   - Press down firmly on the RAM until it clicks into place.

4. **Prepare the Case**
   - Install standoff screws in the case to align with the holes in the motherboard.
   - This ensures the motherboard will be raised slightly off the case, preventing shorts.

5. **Install the Motherboard**
   - Carefully place the motherboard in the case, aligning it with the standoffs.
   - Secure the motherboard with screws, ensuring it's snug and stable.
  
6. **Install the GPU**
   - Identify the appropriate PCIe slot on the motherboard.
   - Align the GPU with the slot and gently press down until it clicks into place.
   - Secure the GPU to the case with screws.

7. **Install Storage**
   - Mount your SSD or HDD in the designated bays in the case.
   - Connect the storage drives to the motherboard using SATA cables and to the power supply with power cables.

8. **Install the PSU**
   - Place the PSU in its designated area in the case.
   - Connect the power cables to the motherboard, GPU, and storage drives, routing cables for neatness and airflow.

9. **Final Checks and First Boot**
   - Double-check all connections, ensuring they are secure and properly seated.
   - Close the case and connect your monitor, keyboard, and mouse.
   - Power on your PC and enter the BIOS/UEFI to ensure everything is functioning as expected.
   - Proceed with the installation of your operating system and drivers.

## Conclusion

### Next Steps
- **Install an Operating System**: If you haven't already, the next step is to install an operating system (OS) like Windows, Linux, or macOS (if compatible).
- **Driver Updates**: Ensure all your hardware is running optimally by installing the latest drivers, especially for your motherboard and GPU.
- **System Monitoring**: Consider installing software to monitor system temperatures, performance, and hardware health.

### Further Learning
- **Overclocking**: Learn about safely overclocking your CPU or GPU to enhance performance.
- **Cooling Optimization**: Explore advanced cooling solutions to improve system efficiency and longevity.
- **Hardware Upgrades**: As technology evolves, so can your PC. Stay informed about new hardware releases for potential upgrades.
