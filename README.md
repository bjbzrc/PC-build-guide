## Intro
Whether you're a gaming enthusiast, a creative professional, or simply someone who loves a good DIY project, building your own PC can be a rewarding and cost-effective way to get exactly the performance you need without having to pay extra for assembly and handling.

Required tools:

* Screwdriver: A magnetic tip Phillips head screwdriver is ideal for most builds.
* Anti-Static Wrist Strap: To protect your components from static electricity.
* Thermal Paste: Essential for installing the CPU cooler (though many coolers come with paste pre-applied).
* Cable Ties: For managing cables and ensuring good airflow.
* Scissors or Snips: To cut cable ties and open packaging.
* Flashlight: Helpful for seeing into your case's nooks and crannies.
* Workspace: A clean, spacious, and static-free surface.

## Components

### 1. **Central Processing Unit (CPU)**
   - **Description**: The CPU is the brain of your computer, handling all instructions it receives from hardware and software.
   - **Installation Tips**: Handle the CPU carefully, aligning it with the motherboard's socket without forcing it.

### 2. **Motherboard**
   - **Description**: This is the main circuit board of your PC. It allows communication between all other components.
   - **Installation Tips**: Secure the motherboard in the case using standoffs and screws.

### 3. **Random Access Memory (RAM)**
   - **Description**: RAM is the short-term memory of your computer, storing data for quick access.
   - **Installation Tips**: Insert RAM sticks into their slots on the motherboard until they click into place.

### 4. **Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)**
   - **Description**: The GPU handles rendering images, video, and animations, especially important for gaming or video editing.
   - **Installation Tips**: Install the GPU into the PCIe slot on the motherboard and secure it to the case.

### 5. **Storage (SSD/HDD)**
   - **Description**: Storage devices hold all your data, programs, and the operating system. SSDs are faster but more expensive than HDDs.
   - **Installation Tips**: Mount the storage drives in the case and connect them to the motherboard and power supply.

### 6. **Power Supply Unit (PSU)**
   - **Description**: The PSU provides power to your PC's components.
   - **Installation Tips**: Fit the PSU into its bay and connect power cables to the motherboard, GPU, and storage drives.

### 7. **PC Case**
   - **Description**: The case houses all your components. It also plays a role in cooling and aesthetics.
   - **Installation Tips**: Choose a case that fits all your components and has good airflow.

### 8. **Cooling System**
   - **Description**: Cooling systems prevent overheating. They can be air coolers or liquid cooling systems.
   - **Installation Tips**: Install the CPU cooler and case fans to ensure adequate airflow.
